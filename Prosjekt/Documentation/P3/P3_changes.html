			<h2>
				Changes to the font
			</h2>
			<p>
				Century Gothic Regular couldn’t be uploaded to our page, because it was blacklisted. Therefore we sat a set of other fonts to replace Century Gothic Regular if it was to fail. These where: Verdana, arial and at last sans-serif, which should work on every single browser and device.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Changes to index.html
			</h2>
			<p>
				Changed the buttons for switching images from white to black. We did this simply because we thought it looked nicer that way, and blended better in.
			</p>
			
			<h2>
				Changes to treatments.html
			</h2>
			<p>
				On this site, we thought before we started programming that it would be nice with an sub-menu with anchor links to the different sections. Although we still think the idea and functionality of it is good, we found it extremely hard to implement it without messing up the design and continuity of the site. Treatments.html contains of seven sections, with sub headliners that are long and hard to compress. We tried to make a separate menu on the left side, but we decided it was better to remove it and keep the clean same look on all sites.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Changes to prices.html
			</h2>
			<p>
				We decided to remove the table and instead list the prices in a way that looked smoother and more user friendly. We also decided to add a text- highlight on mouseover, for manouvering purposes. In addition to these changes we also decided to go with a two- column layout for the final result, which consists of prices to the left hand side, and information about appointment reservations and general information “NB” on the right hand side of the document. 
			</p>

			<h2>
				Changes to products.html 
			</h2>
			<p1>
				We deceided not to go with the headings (h1) in capital lettering after all, because we felt that it drew too much attention. 
			</p1>
			<h2>
				Changes to about.html 
			</h2>
			<p>
				Added ‘*’ on fields that was required and a reminder at the bottom of the form saying ‘*-Må fylles ut’. We did this change so its easier to skip unessesary fields. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				Changes to rollover.js
			</h2>
			<p>
				This has been deleted, because we felt that it didn’t actually bring any value to the site and it sort of became a little “over the top” with unnecessary information.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Changes to tableHighlighting.js
			</h2>
			<p>
				As described in changes to prices.html, we made this functionality in css instead. This is because it was easier to do, and we felt we could do much more in css than in javascript.

			<h2>
				Minimum requirements
			</h2>
			<p>
				Edvard implemented the navigation script and the highlighting of the current active page. Simen implemented the remaining javascript functions of the minimum requirements which was form validation of the contact form, opening a mail client with the entered information and the modularity of the footer.

			</p>
			<h2>
				Modularity
			</h2>
			<p>
				The modularity was handled with javascript. Modularity makes changes that apply for all pages easy to implement. Instead of fixing the same thing on all the pages, it is enough to fix it in one place.
			</p>
			
				Navigation
			<p>
				Edvard implemented the navigation-module (nav.js). The script generates the menu and includes it in the nav- section of the pages. The script also determines which page the user is on (the filename in the url) and mapping this with an array of existing pages. The current page navigation-item is then highlighted with css so that the user easily can see which page they are on.

			</p>
				Footer
			<p>
				The footer is generated in load.js and works much like the nav.js-script. The html generated and is inserted in the footer where id=footer. This is done using innerHTML. Implemented by Simen.
