		<h2>The site's purpose and goals</h2>
		<p>The site’s main purpose is to attract users to go to Spa Thai to receive
			treatment or purchase products. Therefore the site needs to highlight
			everything a user can expect at Spa Thai. The site also needs to have a
			professional look and feel because it reflects the business as a whole.
			It is also vital that the users of the site has very clear access to contact
			information because all transactions are handled in the shop at Spa Thai.</p>
			<p>Their customer base consists of people from different age groups. So we have to consider that not all visitors possess the same skillset in regard to navigating a website.</p>

			<h2>Audience</h2>
			<p>The target audience will mainly consist of people who are looking for,
				or want to book, spa or massage treatment. Key information for these
				potential users are the different products/services and pricing.
				Spa Thai also emphasizes their treatment for sore/stiff muscles which will
				make the site relevant for people that are suffering such ailments.</p>

			<h2>Content of the Website and Organization</h2>
			<p>The site will contain all the necessary contact information,
				as well as the different treatments that are offered and what they cost.
				It will contain the pages: </p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><h3 class="tittelList">Hjem</h3>
						<p>
					Will contain a short introduction of their Spa, treatments and location.
					This will be a very important page and will give new visitors a first
					impression of Spa Thai. The goal is tempting the visitors to consider ordering
					 a treatment.</li></p>

					<li><h3 class="tittelList">Behandlinger</h3>
						<p>
					Here the users will get thorough about the many different treatments Spa Thai
					has to offer. This section will also tell the users about the price,
					so that he doesn’t have to go back the “Prisliste”-page all the time.
					Also, pictures of the treatments will be there to give a short preview of what
					the users can expect.</li></p>

					<li><h3 class="tittelList">Prisliste</h3>
						<p>
					This section will show the prices of all the treatments, so the users
					can get a good overview of all the prices at once. This way it’s easier
					for the users to scope in on the treatments that’s within their price range.
					Even though we already have prices on each treatments in the “Behandlinger”-page,
					 the client wanted to have an overview containing all the prices in one small area.</li></p>

					<li><h3 class="tittelList">Produkter</h3>
						<p>
					This section displays the different products they sell such as lotions,
					gift cards, oils and so forth.</li></p>

					<li><h3 class="tittelList">English summary</h3>
					<p>A short and concise summary of all the other sections in a one page HTML
					written in English. We might also make the site fully supported in english
					but this is not a requirement but rather a suggestion for expansion.</p></li>
